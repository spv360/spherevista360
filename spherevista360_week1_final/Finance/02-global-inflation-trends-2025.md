Inflation remains uneven across regions. Some EMs benefit from commodities; others face currency and input-cost pressures.
Investors need to separate transitory spikes from structural price shifts.

## Key Drivers to Watch
- **Energy & food:** Global supply changes ripple through CPI baskets.  
- **Rates path:** Central bank credibility drives currency stability.  
- **Productivity:** Digitization and logistics matter more than ever.

## Portfolio Positioning
Blend local-currency bonds with global equities; consider defensive sectors and dividend payers.
