Artificial intelligence is no longer a fringe tool in finance—it’s the engine powering research, screening, and risk control.
In 2025, investors use predictive models and AI agents to track markets in real time and rebalance automatically.

## Where AI Adds Real Value
- **Signal discovery:** Models surface factors hidden in earnings calls and alternative data.  
- **Portfolio automation:** Rebalancing and tax-loss harvesting can be rules-based and faster.  
- **Risk controls:** Scenario testing keeps exposure aligned with goals.

## Practical Steps for Beginners
Start small: define an index-heavy core, then test AI tools for screening and monitoring. Always validate output against fundamentals.

## Risks & Good Practices
Black-box models can overfit. Use explainable metrics and diversify sources.

alt: "Inflation graph illustration – Finance"
---

Inflation remains uneven across regions. Some EMs benefit from commodities; others face currency and input-cost pressures.
Investors need to separate transitory spikes from structural price shifts.

## Key Drivers to Watch
- **Energy & food:** Global supply changes ripple through CPI baskets.  
- **Rates path:** Central bank credibility drives currency stability.  
- **Productivity:** Digitization and logistics matter more than ever.

## Portfolio Positioning
Blend local-currency bonds with global equities; consider defensive sectors and dividend payers.

---

Consumers expect finance to be as simple as messaging. Banks and startups are responding with embedded services and instant rails.

## What’s Changing
- **Faster payments:** Real-time transfers reduce float and fees.  
- **Embedded finance:** Credit and payments appear inside non-finance apps.  
- **Personalization:** Data models tailor offers and fraud checks.

## What It Means for Users
Expect cheaper, faster services—if privacy and authentication stay strong.

Cloud selection is now about AI platforms as much as compute price. Multi-cloud guardrails help teams avoid lock-in and outages.

## Head-to-Head Themes
- **AI platforms:** Model hosting, vector stores, and agents.  
- **Networking & egress:** Hidden costs still matter.  
- **FinOps:** Rightsizing and commitment discounts drive savings.

## Picking a Strategy
Align vendor strengths to your workloads; negotiate committed use and consider a small multi-cloud footprint.

Automation cuts both ways. Attackers scale phishing and credential stuffing; defenders use AI to score risk and reduce alert fatigue.

## Practical Defenses
- **MFA everywhere:** Phase out SMS; use passkeys where possible.  
- **Least privilege:** Rotate secrets and audit access.  
- **Automated response:** Contain incidents faster with playbooks.
