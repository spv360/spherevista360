# Google Search Console: URL Removal Requests

## Old URLs to Remove (from your 301 redirects):

Submit these URLs for removal in Google Search Console:

1. `https://spherevista360.com/product-analytics-2025/`
2. `https://spherevista360.com/on-device-vs-cloud-ai-2025/`
3. `https://spherevista360.com/tech-innovation-2025/`
4. `https://spherevista360.com/data-privacy-future/`
5. `https://spherevista360.com/cloud-computing-evolution/`

## How to Submit Removal Requests:

### Step 1: Access Google Search Console
1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
2. Select your property: `https://spherevista360.com/`

### Step 2: Navigate to Removals
1. Click **Removals** in the left sidebar
2. Click **New Request**

### Step 3: Submit Each URL
For each old URL:
1. Select **Remove this URL only**
2. Enter the full URL (including https://)
3. Click **Submit Request**

### Step 4: Monitor Progress
- Check the **Removals** section to see request status
- Removals typically take 1-2 days to process
- You can request up to 1,000 URLs per day

## Important Notes:

### Timing
- Submit removal requests **after** your redirects are live on Hostinger
- Google may take time to discover the redirects naturally
- Removal requests speed up the process

### Best Practices
- Only remove URLs that return 301 redirects
- Don't remove URLs that still serve content
- Monitor your site's performance after removals

### Alternative Approach
Instead of individual requests, you can:
1. Wait for Google to naturally discover your redirects (may take weeks)
2. Use the "Temporary removals" for faster processing
3. Submit a sitemap to help Google discover new URLs faster

## Verification
After removal requests are approved:
- URLs should disappear from search results within 1-2 days
- Check search results for the old URLs
- Verify that redirected URLs appear in search results instead
