Artificial intelligence is no longer a fringe tool in finance—it’s the engine powering research, screening, and risk control.
In 2025, investors use predictive models and AI agents to track markets in real time and rebalance automatically.

## Where AI Adds Real Value
- **Signal discovery:** Models surface factors hidden in earnings calls and alternative data.  
- **Portfolio automation:** Rebalancing and tax-loss harvesting can be rules-based and faster.  
- **Risk controls:** Scenario testing keeps exposure aligned with goals.

## Practical Steps for Beginners
Start small: define an index-heavy core, then test AI tools for screening and monitoring. Always validate output against fundamentals.

## Risks & Good Practices
Black-box models can overfit. Use explainable metrics and diversify sources.
