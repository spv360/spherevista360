Cloud selection is now about AI platforms as much as compute price. Multi-cloud guardrails help teams avoid lock-in and outages.

## Head-to-Head Themes
- **AI platforms:** Model hosting, vector stores, and agents.  
- **Networking & egress:** Hidden costs still matter.  
- **FinOps:** Rightsizing and commitment discounts drive savings.

## Picking a Strategy
Align vendor strengths to your workloads; negotiate committed use and consider a small multi-cloud footprint.
