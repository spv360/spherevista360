AI agents are moving from demos to daily tools. The best automate grunt work—screening, alerts, and simple rebalancing—without handing over full control.
Use them to extend your process, not replace your judgment.

## Where AI Agents Help
- **Signal triage:** Filter noise and surface notable moves.  
- **Rules-based rebalancing:** Execute guardrails you set.  
- **Portfolio hygiene:** Fees, drift, and tax awareness.

## Guardrails
Set position limits, confirm orders manually, and review logs weekly.
