If you want to update multiple categories at once, use this script:

### Quick Script:

```python
import requests

# WordPress credentials
wp_url = "https://spherevista360.com"
username = "JK"
app_password = "BT1I iKXv 6bYv EUuS P2vk K9hV"

# Example: Update Finance category description
category_id = 3  # Replace with actual category ID
new_description = "Your new description here"

endpoint = f"{wp_url}/wp-json/wp/v2/categories/{category_id}"

response = requests.post(
    endpoint,
    auth=(username, app_password),
    json={'description': new_description}
)

if response.status_code == 200:
    print(f"‚úÖ Category updated successfully!")
else:
    print(f"‚ùå Error: {response.status_code}")
    print(response.text)
```

### Get Category IDs First:

```python
import requests

wp_url = "https://spherevista360.com"
username = "JK"
app_password = "BT1I iKXv 6bYv EUuS P2vk K9hV"

endpoint = f"{wp_url}/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?per_page=100"

response = requests.get(endpoint, auth=(username, app_password))

if response.status_code == 200:
    categories = response.json()
    print("\nüìã All Categories:\n")
    print(f"{'ID':<6} {'Name':<20} {'Slug':<20} {'Count':<8}")
    print("-" * 60)
    for cat in categories:
        print(f"{cat['id']:<6} {cat['name']:<20} {cat['slug']:<20} {cat['count']:<8}")
else:
    print(f"‚ùå Error: {response.status_code}")
